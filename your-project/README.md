## Project Description
Compiling and exploring data on world happiness with the objective of explaining the factors that contribute to an idividuals perception of happiness as well as identifying the happiest places on earth. 

## Questions 
What makes us happy based on statistics? Happiest places on earth?

## Dataset
Most of the data used was the result of the Gallup world poll. We also looked at OECD data sets as well as GDP per capita information

## Workflow
Compiled all the data frames and cleaned them up. 
Constructed an interactive dashboard and app then wrote a presentation that flowed nicely with it. 
Finally wrote a medium article where i went in detail with the questions and data we tried to resolve

## Organization
Set up a trello for the initial steps and then followed the natural work flow

The repository is simple, inside of the your-project folder you will find the workspace used for creating the interactive dashboard (as well as a copy so the code can be acessed without messing with the app), a folder with all the datasets and a folder with the Heroku app and link to its own repository
